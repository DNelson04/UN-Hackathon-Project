  <p class="description">CleanCityMap is an innovative and user-friendly mapping platform dedicated to improving urban cleanliness and accessibility. Designed with the bustling streets of New York City in mind, the project focuses on locating and marking essential public facilities such as restrooms and trash cans. Its goal is to empower residents, visitors, and local authorities with real-time data to maintain cleaner and more hygienic city spaces.

    The platform leverages modern web technologies and geolocation tools to provide an interactive experience. Users can quickly find nearby public restrooms and trash disposal sites, view facility details, and even contribute by reporting missing or damaged facilities. This crowdsourced feedback ensures that the platform remains accurate and up-to-date. CleanCityMap aspires to reduce urban littering and enhance public convenience by promoting awareness of available facilities. Its vision is to create a cleaner, more sustainable, and more livable urban environment while fostering community engagement and environmental responsibility.

    The project also holds potential for integration with city management systems, encouraging collaboration between local governments and citizens. In the future, CleanCityMap could expand to include additional features like recycling points, water refill stations, and accessible pathways, making it an essential tool for eco-conscious city living.</p>
